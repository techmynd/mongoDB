// > use 'dbname' will create a new db and switch to that db

insert products as collection in currently selected db and insert one record
> db.products.insertOne({"name": "some name"})
// this will create a new collection and insert this record in it

show currently inserted collection and record in pretty way
> db.products.find().pretty()

> db.products.findOne();

change port (you will have to do it for both mongod and mongo shell)
> mongod --port 27018
> mongo --port 27018
